              If we want to understand the diversity and complexity of ancient ecosystems, we need to agree what we’re measuring.
              The number and disposition of species is a good place to start: but what exactly is a species, and why does a fossil belong to Species X and not Species Y?

                  Evolution – the concept that life has changed through time –
                  is incontrovertibly demonstrated by various disparate lines of data: 
                  genetics, comparative anatomy, biogeography, and of course the fossil record. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mechanism behind evolution has attracted more discussion.
                  The modern view was established in 1859 by Charles Darwin in 
                  <i>On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection</i>.
                  Darwin was trying to make sense of biological variation observed whilst serving as Ship’s Naturalist on the Beagle (1831–36) – a challenge to the prevailing view of the ‘<strong>fixity of species</strong>’.
                  Darwin’s thoughts were inspired by Rev. Thomas Malthus’s famous essay on population growth, and Charles Lyell’s theory of <strong>uniformitarianism</strong>.

                  The process of selection results in populations that are adapted to their environment.  Three modes of selection can be recognized.  If they persist over evolutionary time, they may sculpt the trajectory of species:

                  Lineage splitting – which leads to one species becoming two – can occur through 
                  <strong>sympatric</strong> (‘same land’) or 
                  <strong>allopatric</strong> (‘other lands’) processes.  
                  Sympatric speciation is generally thought to be rare,  as it requires populations that share a space to become reproductively isolated. 
                  Allopatric speciation enforces reproductive isolation by the establishment of a geographical barrier, whether temporary or permanent – often at the periphery of a population (where it is given the more specific term peripatric speciation).  
                  If sufficient evolution has occurred (whether by natural selection or neutral genetic drift), the populations will be unable to interbreed when (if) the barrier is removed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Allopatry and sympatry speak to where evolutionary change occurs.
                  Palaeontologists may also be interested in when it occurs.
                  An enthusiastic uniformitarian such as Darwin might anticipate that the fossil record would indicate continual, gradual evolution.
                  Such <strong><phyletic gradualism</strong> describes the tendency of 
                  a single lineage to change gradually yet consistently over time.
                  In contrast, <strong>punctuated equilibrium</strong> suggests that most evolutionary change is concentrated in short bursts, separated by extended periods of stasis.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are of course compromise positions. Some lineages of planktic foramanifera, for example, exhibit ‘punctuated gradualism’ – gradual change in normal conditions, but rapid change occurring when major environmental perturbations occur. 
                </p>

                <h3>Plus ça change</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
                 <p>
                  Sheldon’s ‘Plus ça change’ model suggests that phyletic gradualism characterises ecological specialists, whose morphology is precisely optimized for a very specific environment that changes slowly if at all, whereas punctuated equilibrium is the norm in ecological generalists that are adapted to an unstable environment, and only undergo change when the environment shifts beyond its usual (broad) range of variation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The incompleteness of the fossil record can make it a little tricky to distinguish the two, but nevertheless many instances of long-term stasis can be recognized – suggesting punctuated equilibrium as the dominant means of evolutionary change.  Punctuated equilibrium is precisely what one would expect to see if peripatric speciation – characterized by the isolation of small populations in fringe environments, with correspondingly marginal preservation potential – is a dominant contributor to life’s increasing diversity.

              This practical will introduce you to trilobites and brachiopods.  You should also have time to meet the bryozoans and corals.  Together these four groups are perhaps the most abundant and important that lived during the Palaeozoic.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’re going to consider the process of classification, and along the way try to learn how best to study fossil material.  There is often more to a fossil than meets the eye, and the art of identifying fossils and extracting data from them is largely a process of training the eye to make careful observations.

                  The first part of our exercise will train you in the basics of 
                  palaeontological observations.  
                  We'll start by working with the two trilobite specimens below.

                <p>Two key skills in the palaeontologist’s toolkit are valuable aids in this process.
                </p><p>
                  Sketching fossils is important not just because it allows you to remember what the fossil looked like later – a photograph could do that – but also because it forces you to observe and interpret features in the specimen.
                  When you were just looking at the fossil, you might not have paid much attention to the number of ridges (say) or the angle between them – sketching a fossil compels you to observe such details.
                </p>
              </div>

                  Using appropriate terminology is also enormously helpful.
                  Unfamiliar terms can be a pain to memorize, but it’s much easier and more precise to say “facial suture” than “the wiggly line that runs along the head bit”, and someone else who knows the lingo will know straight away what you mean.
                  What is more, the vocabulary of technical terms is carefully chosen to refer to features that are homologous (i.e. equivalent, or inherited from a last common ancestor) within a group.
                  This means that the same word can be used for different fossils within that group, and often means that the absence of such and such a feature is in itself notable.
                  Finally, each term is something that can be described; once you know what a delthyrium is, you might notice differences in the delthyrium shape that you would otherwise have overlooked.
                </p><p>
                  Grab a pencil and paper and produce labelled sketches of the two fossils you have chosen.
                  Refer to the <a href="https://duo.dur.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-6189694-dt-content-rid-21135769_2/xid-21135769_2" title="Crib sheets on DUO">crib sheet</a> to see the terms as they apply to idealized fossils, then identify the features on your own fossils.
                  A good sketch need not be an artistic masterwork: focus on keeping your drawing as simple as possible, whilst depicting (and annotating) the key features of the fossil.  Use all the available space, drawing the fossil from different angles if necessary. 
                </p>
                <ul><li class="caution">Remember to include a scale. 
                The larger speciemen in the first image is 40&nbsp;mm long; the specimen in the second image, 60&nbsp;mm.</li></ul>
                <p>
                  Once you've completed your sketches, write a new list of the morphological differences between the specimens.
                  </li>

						<h2>Trophic structure</h2>
						<p>The trophic structure of an ecosystem describes the flow of resources 
                  from primary producers to higher levels of the food chain.
                  Primary producers mark the bottom of the <strong>trophic pyramid</strong>.
                  As a means of generating biomass, eating is around 10% efficient; 
                  as such, higher levels of the trophic pyramid represent progressively 
                  rarer components of living communities.

                  How might the presence of photosynthesizers in a fossil assemblage help

                  <p>
                  Simple answer: Photosynthesis requires shallow water: <&nbsp;200&nbsp;m
                  if water is clear (i.e. low sedimentary energy), much less if water
                  is turbid (e.g. high sedimentary energy, or perhaps eutrophic conditions?)

                  <p>Caveat: Were the photosynthesizers truly living in the envinroment
                  in which they were deposited?
                  Could they have been washed in, or sunk from shallower overlying waters?</p>

                <li class="answer hidden" id="ppmc">
                  Most photosynthesis is conducted by phytoplankton.
                  Though individually tiny, they can live anywhere in the top 200&nbsp;m
                  of the oceans – an enormous volume, in contrast to macroalgae,
                  which can only live close to shallow sea floors – i.e. 
                  fringing continents.
                  Seaweeds are thus individually large and locally important, but only
                  account for a couple of percent of the total carbon fixation of the 
                  global oceans.

                  Chalk) their mineralized skeletons, lacking in nutrients, can dominate
                  sediment, whereas consumers might be more attractive to scavengers.</p>

						<h2>Consumers</h2>
						<p>If producers are at the base of the trophic pyramid, let's work our way up.
            Primary consumers feed on primary producers, moving the resources fixed by

							<div class="col-4 col-12-narrow">
								<h3>What primary consumers eat</h3>
								<p>In terrestrial ecosystems, typical occupants of the higher levels of 
                the trophic pyramid are herbivores (on level two) and carnivores 
                (whether active predators or scavengers). 
                Marine ecosystems differ from terrestrial ones in that there is an 
                abundance of food available in the form of suspended organic matter:
                these particles include <strong>phytoplankton</strong> 
                (<strong>autotrophic</strong> micro-organisms that 
                are typically photosynthetic and often unicellular),
                <strong>zooplankton</strong> (<strong>heterotrophic</strong> animals such 
                as krill that feed on phytoplankton), and <strong>faecal pellets</strong>
                that rapidly transport organic matter to the sea floor.
                <p>
                
                <p>The fate of these particles, as with any other sedimentary particle,
                depends on the energy levels at the sea floor.  
                In high energy environments, the particles will typically be suspended in 
                the seawater as waves and currents churn them up;
                in low energy environments, the particles will settle on the sea bed 
                and eventually be buried.
                </p>
                
                <p>As such, <strong>suspension feeders</strong> – 
                which feed on particles in suspension –
                will be more abundant in high-energy environments, 
                whereas <strong>deposit feeders</strong> – which extract organic material 
                (particles and the bacteria that degrade them) from the mud of the sea bed
                – tend to proliferate low energy environments.</p>
                
                <h3>Where primary consumers live</h3>
                <p>The proportion of infaunal deposit feeders may reflect oxygen levels 
                within the sediment, but is particularly vulnerable to distortion by 
                preservational processes. 
                (Why might this be?  
                You should think about this again after the Taphonomy session).
                </p>
                
                <p>The nature and abundance of sessile suspension feeders may reflect the
                firmness of the substrate – soupy sediment lacks attachment points and can
                only be colonized by ‘floating’ taxa (icebergs / snow shoes). 
                A high diversity of predators is indicative of a full and diverse community
                (typical of a stable and tolerable environment) with more biomass and more
                opportunity to specialize on particular prey taxa.
                </p>

<h2>Opening scans locally</h2>


<p>
3D virtual rock scans are created from representative hand specimens using a technique known as photogrammetry. You can zoom in and out and rotate the virtual hand specimens.

</p>
<p>

Each 3D virtual rock scan folder contains 3 files, XXX.jpeg, XXX.obj and XXX.mtl. Download the 3 files to a folder on your computer. There are a number of options for opening them. Which option works for you depends on the operating system and the hardware capabilities of your computer. You may need to try a number of them. Contact Richard.brown3@durham.ac.uk if none work.
